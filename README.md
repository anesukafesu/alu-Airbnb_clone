# alu-Airbnb_clone
## Description
This is a school project whereby we replicate a simplified AirBnB. The object of the project is to learn how to build enterprise-grade web applications.

## Command Interpreter
The first part of this project is a command interpreter. This will be used to interact with the system and data from the command-line

### Example commands
`./console` - will start the interpreter

After which, you will see a prompt to enter commands. Inside the prompt, you can enter some of the following commands:
`help` - will list all available commands
`help <command>` will display help for the particular command

You can also enter commands directly to the interpreter like so
`echo 'help' | ./console.py`
